### Test Report: Battery Monitoring System

#### Overview:
The code was designed to monitor key parameters of a battery (temperature, state of charge (SOC), and charge rate) and report any deviations from the defined safe operating ranges. It also includes a simplified reporting mechanism using the `DetailedReporter` class to output error messages when the parameters breach acceptable limits.

#### Test Cases:
1. **Case 1: All Parameters Within Safe Range**
   - Input: `temperature = 25`, `soc = 70`, `charge_rate = 0.7`
   - Expected Output: `True`
   - Result: Passed
   
2. **Case 2: Temperature and SOC Out of Range**
   - Input: `temperature = 50`, `soc = 85`, `charge_rate = 0`
   - Expected Output: `False`, report for high temperature and high SOC
   - Result: Passed
   - Reporter Output:
     - "Temperature is too high! Value: 50, Max: 45"
     - "State of Charge is too high! Value: 85, Max: 80"
   
3. **Case 3: Temperature and Charge Rate Out of Range**
   - Input: `temperature = -2`, `soc = 40`, `charge_rate = 0.9`
   - Expected Output: `False`, report for low temperature and high charge rate
   - Result: Passed
   - Reporter Output:
     - "Temperature is too low! Value: -2, Min: 0"
     - "Charge Rate is too high! Value: 0.9, Max: 0.8"
   
4. **Case 4: Parameters on Boundary Values (Edge Case)**
   - Input: `temperature = 0`, `soc = 20`, `charge_rate = 0.8`
   - Expected Output: `True`
   - Result: Passed

#### Summary:
- **All test cases passed** successfully.
- The `DetailedReporter` correctly outputs messages whenever a parameter is out of range, providing clear information about the specific parameter and the direction of the breach (too high or too low).
- The system handles both normal and boundary conditions effectively.
